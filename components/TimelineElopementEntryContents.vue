      After thinking about it, we both realized that we just wanted to get married this year! Goodness knows, we could all use a good excuse to celebrate <i>something</i> in 2020, and we weren’t going to let a pandemic, courthouse closures, or a sweaty hike to the top of a mountain stop us. We opted to have a tiny ceremony at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/RJfo6gd9b9xBoNn18">Artist Point</a> on our original date with the minimum legally-required number of people, and for us, it really was a perfect day.

      Thank you to everybody for your support in both our lives. We’re so excited to party with you next September!

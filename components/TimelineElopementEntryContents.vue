    <p>We were crushed that we weren't able to have our wedding on August 2nd as planned, so we wanted to do something to celebrate our relationship on that day. Then we realized: we couldn't have a big celebration with all our friends, but we <i>could</i> still get married!</p><p>Sabreen, April, and Farraz helped us find <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/RJfo6gd9b9xBoNn18">an incredible location</a>, then served as our officiant, photographers, and witnesses as we (legally) tied the knot!"</p>

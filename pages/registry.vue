      <p>Hello friends and family!</p>
      
      <p>Thank you for being part of our lives.</p>
      
      <p>
        This has been a really hard year for a lot of people, and if you're not in a position to give gifts
         that's totally fine! Your presence at the wedding is more than enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, on top of the impending wedding, we've just  moved to a new home, and would love some help in settling in.
        Since we won't be able to fit too many items in our suitcases, cash or checks are probably the best gifts to bring to the wedding!
        However, if you'd prefer a more traditional gift, we do have a few registries set up (with our <i>new</i> address)!
